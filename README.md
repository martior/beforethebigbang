```
there was no up
there was no down
there as no side to side
    
there was no light
there was no dark
nor shape of any kind

there was as no starts
or planet Mars
or protons to colide

there was no up
there was no down
there was no side to side

and further more
to underscore
this total lacking state

there was no here
there was no there
because there was no space

and in this endless void
which can’t be though of as a place
there was no time
and so no passing minutes hours days

of all the paradoxes
that belabor common sense 
i think this one’s the greates
this time before events

because how did we get from nothing 
to infinitely dense?
from immeasurably small
to inconceivably immense?

but before we get unmoored 
from the question at the start
let’s take a breath and marvel
at when math becomes an art

because we don’t have to understand it 
to know there was a time

when there was no up
there was no down
there was no side to side 
```
