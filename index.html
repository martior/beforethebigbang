    <p>
    there was no up <br />
    there was no down <br />
    there was no side to side <br />
    </p>
    <p>
    there was no light <br />
    there was no dark <br />
    nor shape of any kind <br />
</p>
<p>
    there was no stars <br />
    or planet Mars 	<br />
    or protons to colide <br />
    
</p>
<p>
    there was no up <br />
    there was no down <br />
    there was no side to side <br />
</p>
<p>
    and further more <br />
    to underscore <br />
    this total lacking state <br />
</p>
<p>
    there was no here <br />
    there was no there <br />
    because there was no space <br />
</p>
<p>
    and in this endless void <br />
    which can’t be though of as a place <br />
    there was no time <br />
    and so no passing minutes hours days <br />
</p>
<p>
    of all the paradoxes <br />
    that belabor common sense  <br />
    i think this one’s the greates <br />
    this time before events <br />
</p>
<p>
    because how did we get from nothing  <br />
    to infinitely dense? <br />
    from immeasurably small <br />
    to inconceivably immense? <br />
</p>
<p>
    but before we get unmoored  <br />
    from the question at the start <br />
    let’s take a breath and marvel <br />
    at when math becomes an art <br />
</p>
<p>
    because we don’t have to understand it  <br />
    to know there was a time <br />
</p>
<p>
    when there was no up <br />
    there was no down <br />
    there was no side to side  <br />
